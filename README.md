# ðŸŽµ spotify proxy service

in simple words, this is third party service where you can access to spotify web api without authentication. LOL.
basically, i wanted to show my favorite musics playlist in my portfolio website. i found out that you have to create app in spotify web api which provides you with
client_id and client_secret, which you can use to access their playlists. yea, i could easily add 5 musics in my frontend app, like my friend said,
but i created problem from the solution. so with this service i can access to spotify playlists without token and others as well without creating app in spotify.

its not finished yet and deployed :). there is new problem now - with deployment. i dont wanna deploy on some paas or saas things. i wanna experience real deployment. 
however, for that i dont have even visa card. xD

## âœ¨ features

- generates token automatically
- get playlists by id (i have not tested yet -_-)
- get my playlist (this is workin)

## status

currently cookin when i have time and desire
